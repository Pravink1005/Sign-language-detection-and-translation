Sign Language Detection and Translation
This project focuses on detecting and translating sign language using OpenCV and cvzone. It aims to assist in real-time communication by identifying specific sign language gestures and providing accurate translations. The solution is geared toward enhancing accessibility and bridging the gap for people who rely on sign language for communication.

This project leverages computer vision techniques to recognize hand gestures and translate them into readable or spoken language. With an increasing need for inclusivity, this project helps to facilitate interaction between the hearing-impaired and others.

Features
Real-time gesture recognition: Detects and identifies hand gestures using OpenCV and cvzone.
Accurate translation of signs: Offers reliable detection and translation for a range of gestures.
User-friendly interface: Provides easy-to-use controls for starting and stopping gesture detection.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
cvzone
